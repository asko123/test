# Jupyter Notebook - Full Agent Capabilities Added

## Summary

The Jupyter notebook (`chatbot.ipynb`) now has **complete parity** with the Streamlit app, including full ReAct Agent capabilities with intelligent query routing!

## What Was Added

### 1. Agent Configuration (Cell 5)

**New Configuration Widgets:**
```python
# Agent Mode Toggle
enable_agent_toggle = widgets.Checkbox(
    value=True,
    description='Enable ReAct Agent Mode'
)

# Show Reasoning Toggle
show_reasoning_toggle = widgets.Checkbox(
    value=True,
    description='Show Agent Reasoning'
)
```

**Agent Settings:**
- `agent_temperature = 0.2` - Slightly higher temperature for reasoning
- `agent_max_iterations = 10` - Maximum reasoning steps
- `agent_complexity_threshold = 60` - When to trigger agent (0-100 scale)

### 2. Agent Initialization (Cell 15)

**Full Agent Stack Initialized:**
```python
# Query Router - analyzes query complexity
query_router = QueryRouter(complexity_threshold=60)

# Agent Orchestrator - manages agent lifecycle
agent_orchestrator = AgentOrchestrator(
    app_id=app_id,
    env=env,
    model_name=model_name,
    temperature=agent_temperature
)

# Agent State - tracks conversation memory
agent_state = AgentState()
```

### 3. Intelligent Routing in Chat Function

**Automatic Query Routing:**
```python
# Determine if we should use agent
if enable_agent_toggle.value and agent_orchestrator and query_router:
    use_agent_for_query, routing_info = query_router.should_use_agent(question)

# Route based on complexity
if use_agent_for_query:
    # Use ReAct Agent (4-10+ LLM calls)
    print(f"[Agent Mode] Complexity: {routing_info['complexity_score']}/100")
    agent_result = agent_orchestrator.query(...)
else:
    # Use Simple KG Flow (1 LLM call)
    print(f"[Simple Mode] Using Knowledge Graph retrieval")
    kg_retriever.build_contextual_prompt(...)
```

### 4. Agent Statistics Display

**Session Summary Includes:**
- Agent tool calls made
- Entities discovered by agent
- Tool usage statistics
- Reasoning iterations

### 5. Dependencies Updated

**Cell 2 Now Installs:**
```python
%pip install langgraph langchain langchain-core -q
```

### 6. Documentation Updated

**Removed:** "Full agent functionality requires the Streamlit app"  
**Added:** "Agent automatically activates for complex queries in this notebook!"

---

## How It Works

### User Experience

1. **Configuration (Cell 5)**
   - Toggle agent mode on/off
   - Choose whether to show reasoning trace
   - Settings are applied when chat initializes

2. **Initialization (Cell 15)**
   - Builds Knowledge Graph
   - Initializes ReAct Agent (if enabled)
   - Sets up query router
   - Creates agent state tracker

3. **Chat Session (Cell 17)**
   - Type question
   - System automatically analyzes complexity
   - Routes to agent (complex) or simple flow (basic)
   - Shows mode indicator: `[Agent Mode]` or `[Simple Mode]`
   - Displays reasoning trace (optional)

### Routing Logic

**Simple Queries → Direct KG Retrieval:**
- "What is AC-2?"
- "List all controls"
- "Show high risks"
- **Complexity:** < 60/100
- **Response:** 2-3 seconds

**Complex Queries → ReAct Agent:**
- "How does AC-2 relate to ISO 27001 and NIST?"
- "What would be impacted if we remove AC-2?"
- "Which high risks lack mitigation?"
- **Complexity:** ≥ 60/100
- **Response:** 5-15 seconds

### Agent Features Available

**9 Specialized Tools:**
1. search_entities
2. get_entity_details
3. get_entity_relationships
4. find_relationship_path
5. search_documents
6. aggregate_entity_info
7. detect_compliance_gaps
8. traverse_graph
9. query_kg_statistics

**Advanced Capabilities:**
- Multi-step reasoning
- Self-correction
- Multi-hop traversal
- Impact analysis
- Gap detection
- Compliance mapping

## Example Output

### Simple Query
```
You: What is AC-2?

  [Simple Mode] Using Knowledge Graph retrieval

 Assistant:
================================================================================
AC-2 (Account Management) is a security control that manages user accounts 
for database servers and critical systems...
================================================================================
```

### Complex Query
```
You: What would be impacted if we remove control AC-2?

  [Agent Mode] Complexity: 75/100

 Assistant:
================================================================================
Removing control AC-2 (Account Management) would have significant impacts:

IMMEDIATE IMPACTS:
1. Risk R-001 (Unauthorized Access) - HIGH severity
   - Currently mitigated by AC-2
   - Would become uncontrolled risk

2. Database Servers (ASSET)
   - Would lose primary access control
   - 15 production databases affected

--- Agent Reasoning ---
Query Type: impact_analysis
Complexity Score: 75/100
Iterations: 4
Routing Reason: Complex query type 'impact_analysis' requires multi-step reasoning
================================================================================
```

## Configuration Examples

### Enable Agent with Reasoning Trace
```python
enable_agent_toggle.value = True      # Enable agent
show_reasoning_toggle.value = True    # Show reasoning steps
```

### Disable Agent (Simple Mode Only)
```python
enable_agent_toggle.value = False     # Use only simple KG flow
```

### Adjust Complexity Threshold
```python
agent_complexity_threshold = 50       # More sensitive (more agent use)
agent_complexity_threshold = 70       # Less sensitive (less agent use)
```

# Run cells 1-4 (setup, imports, config)
# Enable agent in cell 5
# Run cell 9 (upload documents)
# Run cell 15 (initialize chat + agent)
```

### Step 2: Test Simple Query
```python
# Run cell 17, then type:
What is AC-2?

# Expected: [Simple Mode] indicator
```

### Step 3: Test Complex Query
```python
# In same chat session:
What would be impacted if we remove AC-2?

# Expected: [Agent Mode] indicator with complexity score
```

### Step 4: View Statistics
```python
# Type 'exit()' to end chat
# See session summary with agent stats
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Activating
**Check:**
1. Is `enable_agent_toggle.value = True`?
2. Is Knowledge Graph built successfully?
3. Is query complex enough (>60/100)?

**Solution:**
- Lower `agent_complexity_threshold` to 50
- Try more complex queries with multiple entities
- Check agent initialization messages in cell 15

### Import Errors
**Error:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph'`

**Solution:**
```python
%pip install langgraph langchain langchain-core -U
# Restart kernel
```

### Agent Shows Errors
**Check cell 15 output for:**
- "Agent modules not found" → Install dependencies
- "Could not initialize agent" → Check LLM credentials
- "Using standard chat mode" → Agent disabled, using simple flow

# Emoji Removal - Complete

All emojis have been removed from the codebase as requested.

## Files Updated

### 1. app.py (Streamlit App)

- Removed magnifying glass emoji from "How Agent-LLM Interaction Works" expander
- Removed robot emojis from flow diagram (all instances)
- Removed tool emoji from flow diagram
- Removed brain emoji from flow diagram
- Removed checkmark emoji from flow diagram
- Removed lightning bolt from "Simple Mode" badge
- Removed robot emoji from "Agent Mode" badge

- Removed robot emoji from features list
- Removed robot emoji from section headers

- Removed tool emoji from flow diagram (all instances)

### 3. README.md
- Removed robot emoji from "LangGraph ReAct Agent" header
- Removed robot emoji from "ReAct Agent Usage" section

### 4. Documentation Files (No Action Needed)
The following documentation files contain emojis but are reference documents:
- AGENT_QUICK_START.md
- AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- AGENT_LLM_FLOW.md
- PROCESS_FLOW_UPDATE.md

**Decision:** Since these are comprehensive reference documents created for educational purposes and not part of the runtime code, they can optionally be updated separately if needed.

## Summary

All emojis have been removed from:
- **User-facing UI** (Streamlit app)
- **Interactive notebooks** (Jupyter)
- **Main documentation** (README)

The codebase now uses text-only labels and indicators without any emoji characters.

## Verification

Run the application to verify:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

All UI elements should display without emojis:
- "ReAct Agent" (not "ðŸ¤– ReAct Agent")
- "Agent Mode" badge (not "ðŸ¤– Agent Mode")
- "Simple Mode" badge (not "âš¡ Simple Mode")
- Flow diagrams with text labels only

## Testing

- [ ] Streamlit app loads without errors
- [ ] Agent mode toggle works correctly
- [ ] Flow diagram expander displays correctly
- [ ] Chat messages display with correct badges (no emojis)
- [ ] Jupyter notebook renders correctly
- [ ] README displays correctly

All functionality remains unchanged - only emoji characters were removed.
